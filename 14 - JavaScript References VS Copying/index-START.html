    name2 = 'Wallen';

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team[1] = 'Daniel';

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(team, players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[1] = 'Daniel';
    console.log(team, team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[1] = 'Dixie';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[1] = 'Dave';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[1] = 'Dog';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const general = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 100, age: 32 });
    console.log(person, general);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const president = {...person};
    president.name = 'Donald';
    console.log(person, president);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
